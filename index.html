        <b>Bio</b><br>
        I'm a Junior at Bowdoin College studying Economics and Psychology.
        I love grasping complex Economic models and learning more about human 
        behavior. Outside of classroom, I'm a member of Polar Investment Club
        where I extract and analyze important news about the market, businesses, 
        stocks, equity, macroeconomic trends, and ESG. I also joined the Obvious
        dance club because I absolutely love hiphop! For my future career, currently 
        I'm working towards investment. After getting a taste of what the world of
        investment is like through my summer internship at an Accelerator/VC, I found 
        it really interesting to know about various startups embracing innovative and
        disruptive technologies during the deal sourcing process.<br><br>

        passionate baker. Cream puffs and lemon yogurt cake are my ultimate treats.
